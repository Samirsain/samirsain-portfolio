  about: `
I’m **Samir Sain**, a passionate self-taught coder with **5 years of hands-on experience** in building modern digital solutions. Coding is not just my skill — it’s something I genuinely enjoy, experiment with, and constantly improve at. Over the years, I’ve worked as a freelancer, creating websites, tools, and smart solutions that actually solve real problems.

I completed my **Full Stack Development course from Ducat Institute**, where I strengthened my foundations in **Python**, **JavaScript**, and multiple modern technologies. Since then, my focus has been clear — to build useful projects, create real value, and grow my name through quality work.

My goal is simple:
**Build products that matter, help businesses grow, and keep improving myself as a developer daily.**

With a strong mindset, consistent learning, and love for coding, I’m committed to creating meaningful digital experiences that leave an impact.
